# 🎥 Syntax Animations

Turn your code into animated videos for social media, tutorials, or documentation — with style.

Unlike plain screen recordings, Syntax Animations works by creating slides for each step of your code. You decide how your snippet evolves — adding lines, refactoring, or changing variables — and the app smoothly animates the transitions between those slides.

The result? Beautiful, intentional animations that are clear, educational, and fun to watch.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📚 Slide-based code animation – break your code into steps and animate between them.

- 🌈 Supports any language – powered by TextMate grammars.

- 🎨 Custom themes – use any color theme for your code.

- 📱 Perfect for sharing – great for social media, tutorials, or classroom use.

## 🎬 Usage

- Paste or write your code.

- Create slides for each step or change.

- Preview transitions automatically between slides.

- Play and Export as video ready to share online.
